        <p class="description">A fjord is a long, deep, narrow body of water that reaches
             far inland. Fjords are often set in a U-shaped valley with
            steep walls of rock on either side. Fjords are found mainly
            in Norway, Chile, New Zealand, Canada, Greenland, and the
             U.S. state of Alaska.

        <p class="description">The word forest broadly describes an area that has a large number of trees.
             There are three general types of forest that exist: temperate, tropical,
             and boreal. Experts estimate that these forests cover approximately 
             one-third of Earth's surface.
